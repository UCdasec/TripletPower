# TripletPower

** The dataset and code are for research purpose only**

TripletPower aims to reduce the number of training traces for deep-learning side-channel attacks. Specifically, TripletPower leverages Triplet Networks and can reduce the number of training traces to hundreds. 

## Reference
When reporting results that use the dataset or code in this repository, please cite the paper below:
